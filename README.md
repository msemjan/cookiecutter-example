# Cookiecutter Example

Hi, welcome! This repository is an example of a [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) template made from scratch that I wrote for my blog.

## Using This Example

Clone and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/msemjan/cookiecutter-example.git
cookiecutter cookiecutter-example
```

Run without cloning:
```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/msemjan/cookiecutter-example.git
```
